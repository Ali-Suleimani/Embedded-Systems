# Embedded-Systems
## course content
- Labs to become familiar with software and hardware.

- The course is carried out by means of computer-based tools.

- Examples of different kinds of microprocessors and operating systems.

- Examples of interface and communication.

- Programming environments, programming language and programming.

- System tools and system design.

- Real-time consequences.
## Intended learning outcomes
- describe the design process for an embedded system
- interpret requirements and write specification
- create architecture for both hardware and software 
- describe the structure of a microcontroller 
- describe how I/O ports are used for external signals and communication between circuits 
- compare and analyse different ways to manage real-time problems 
- implement the software based on a given problem 
- give examples of hard and soft real-time issues 
- describe common methods for scheduling of processes and describe how communication between processes can be carried out 
- use real-time operating system to implement a program in a time-critical embedded system 
- plan, design and carry out a strategy for testing  
- write a report to document a system.
